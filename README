Interface stack is created with three methods definitions in it i.e push(), pop() and display().
Both FixedStack and VariableStack are initially given the size of value 5.
For the VariableStack when the size reaches the given size then we increase the size of the stack by a factor of 2 in the extendStack method.
Push(), pop() and display functions are written.
Importance of interface is understood.
